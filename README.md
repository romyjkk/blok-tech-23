Welcome to the MovieMatcher repository.
MovieMatcher is a matching application where users can match with a movie, based on their preferences.
You can make it as specific as you want, it's possible to filter on a few different things like movie length and genre.
If a movie matches your taste, you can add it to your list. You can access this list and give a review if you watched the movie so the algorithm can give you even more specific recommendations, or remove it if you don't want to watch it after all.
Did you delete a movie by accident? No problem, you can search it and add it to your list again.
